//! 3 things node.js has that the client side javascript doesnâ€™t have: (in the browser)

//TODO 1. Browser has window object
// node.js has the global object.
//because windows is part of the browser environment.
//node.js doesn't run on the browser.

//TODO2. process object: it exist just in node.js.
// browser has document (like documeny query selector)
//

//TODO3. node.js has file system , js doesn't have it.

//TODO4.(Extra): node.js doesn't have an access to local storage. Js has an acess to local storage.
